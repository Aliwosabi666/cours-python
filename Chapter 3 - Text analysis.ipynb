Each sentence will be represented as a new string, so the function as a whole returns a list of sentence strings.

Notice that we add 1 to the end position. Why would that be? This is because as you might remember from the first chapter, slices are non-inclusive, so `text[start:end]` would return the text starting at `start` and ending 1 index before `end`. Since we have reached the end of a sentence, we know that the next sentence will start at least 1 position later than our last end point. Therefore, we update the start variable to `end + 1`.
