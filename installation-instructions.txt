Installation instructions for sublime text 2, python3 and ipython3 on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux
=================================================================================================

This document describes the installation procedure for all the software needed for the Python class. If your stuck anywhere in the installation procedure, please do not hesitate to contact Folgert Karsdorp (folgert.karsdorp@meertens.knaw.nl).

=============
# All systems
=============

We advice you to install a good text editor, Sublime text 2. However, you are absolutely free to use your own favourite editor. For Sublime Text 2 go to http://www.sublimetext.com/ download the version for your operating system and install.

We will be using Python 3 for our course, so lower versions of Python are not sufficient. 

=============
# Windows
=============

1. Download and install pyzo from http://www.pyzo.org/downloads.html (use pyzo_distro-2013b.win32.exe)
2. After (default) installation python3 resides in the folder c:\pyzo2013b 
3. Check your installation by double clicking ipython3.exe. 
4. For the course you will need to use iPython's notebook. To launch the notebook you will have to open `Command Prompt' (`Opdrachtprompt' in Dutch). First go to the right folder by typing:

    cd c:\pyzo2013b

After that launch the notebook with:

    ipython3.exe notebook

If everything goes right, this should open your browser (preferably Google Chrome or Firefox) on a page http://127.0.0.1:8888/ (or something similar) which says `IP[y]: Notebook'

=============
# OS X 
=============

1. Download python3 from http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.0/python-3.3.0-macosx10.6.dmg
2. Follow the default installation procedures of the package.
3. Open spotlight and type in `terminal' to open the terminal application. (You can also go to your applications folder and then to utilities where you'll find the terminal.app)
4. You will need to install a couple of python packages using pip3:
   - Install readline. In the terminal type:

        sudo pip3 install readline

   This will ask you for your password. (You won't see any *'s but that's just fine.)

   - Install ipython3. In the terminal type:

       sudo pip3 install ipython

   - Install tornado. In the terminal type:

       sudo pip3 install tornado

   - Install pyzmq. In the terminal type:

       sudo pip3 install pyzmq

5. To check you installation, relaunch the terminal app. Then type in 

    ipython notebook 

   If everything went well this should open your browser (best with Google Chrome or Firefox) on the page http://127.0.0.1:8888/ which says IP[y]: Notebook.

========================
# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
========================

1. Open a terminal
2. Type: sudo apt-get install python3 ipython3 ipython3-notebook  

If you run another Linux distribution, similar packages should be available.
