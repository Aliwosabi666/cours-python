Ja'afar bin Musa al-Hadi once had a slave-girl, a lutist, called Al-Badr al-Kabir, than whom there was not in her time a fairer of face nor shapelier of shape nor a more elegant of manners nor a more accomplished in the art of singing and striking the strings; she was indeed perfect in beauty and extreme in every charm.
