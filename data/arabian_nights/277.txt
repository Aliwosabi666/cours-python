 There was once a Shepherd, who fed a flock of sheep in the wold and kept over
  them strait watch. One night, there came to him a Rogue thinking to steal some
  of his charges and, finding him assiduous in guarding them, sleeping not by
  night nor neglecting them by day, prowled about him all the livelong night,
  but could plunder nothing from him. So, when he was weary of striving, he betook
  himself to another part of the waste and trapping a lion, skinned him and stuffed
  his hide with bruised straw, after which he set it up on a high place in the
  desert, where the Shepherd might see it and be assured thereof. Then he accosted
 the Shepherd and said to him, "Yonder lion hath sent me to demand his supper of these sheep." The Shepherd asked, "Where is the lion?" and the Rogue answered, "Lift thine eyes; there he standeth." So the Shepherd raised his eyes and, seeing the semblance, deemed it a very lion and was much Frighted;--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
 When it was the Nine Hundred and Twenty-second Night, 
She resumed: It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Shepherd saw the semblance of the lion, he deemed it a very lion and was Frighted with the sorest fright, trembling for dread so he said to the thief, "O my brother take what thou wilt, I will not gainsay thee." Accordingly the Rogue took what he would of the sheep and redoubled in greed by reason of the excess of the Shepherd's fear. Accordingly, every little while, he would hie to him and terrify him, saying, "The lion hath need of this and requireth that, and his intent is to do thus and thus," and take his sufficiency of the sheep; and he stinted not to do thus with him, till he had wasted the most part of his flock. "This, O King," added the favourite, "I tell thee only that thou suffer not the Grandees of thy realm to be deluded by thy mildness and easiness of temper and presume on thee; and, in right rede, their death were better than that they deal thus with thee." Quoth the King, "I accept this thy counsel and will not hearken to their admonition neither will I go out unto them."
