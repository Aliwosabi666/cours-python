 There was once in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before, in
  the land of Hind, a mighty King, tall of presence and fair of favour and goodly
  of parts, noble of nature and generous, beneficent to the poor and loving to
  his lieges and all the people of his realm. His name was Jali'ad and under
  his hand were two-and-seventy Kings and in his cities three hundred and fifty
  Kazis. He had three score and ten Wazirs and over every ten of them he set
  a premier. The chiefest of all his ministers was a man called Shimas who was
  then two and twenty years old, a statesman of pleasant presence and noble nature,
  sweet of speech and ready in reply; shrewd in all manner of business, skilful
  withal and sagacious for all his tender age, a man of good counsel and fine
  manners versed in all arts and sciences and accomplishments; and the King loved
  him with exceeding love and cherished him by reason of his proficiency in eloquence
  and rhetoric and the art of government and for that which Allah had given him
  of compassion and brooding care with his lieges for he was a King just in his
  Kingship and a protector of his peoples, constant in beneficence to great and
  small and giving them that which befitted them of good governance and bounty
  and protection and security and a lightener of their loads in taxes and tithes.
  And indeed he was loving to them each and every, high and low, entreating them
  with kindness and solicitude and governing them in such goodly guise as none
  had done before him. But, with all this, Almighty Allah had not blessed him
  with a child, and this was grievous to him and to the people of his reign.
  It chanced, one night, as Jali'ad lay in his bed, occupied with anxious thought
  of the issue of the affair of his Kingdom, that sleep overcame him and he dreamt
  that he poured water upon the roots of a tree,--And Shahrazad perceived the
 dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
 When it was the Nine Hundredth Night,
She continued: It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King saw himself in his vision pouring water upon the roots of a tree, about which were many other trees; and lo and behold! there came fire out of this tree and burnt up every growth which encompassed it; whereupon Jali'ad awoke affrighted and trembling, and calling one of his pages said to him, "Go fetch the Wazir Shimas in all haste." So he betook himself to Shimas and said to him, "The King calleth for thee forthright because he hath awoke from his sleep in fright and hath sent me to bring thee to him in haste." When Shimas heard this, he arose without stay or delay and going to the King, found him seated on his bed. He prostrated himself before him, wishing him permanence of glory and prosperity, and said, "May Allah not cause thee grieve, O King! What hath troubled thee this night, and what is the cause of thy seeking me thus in haste?" The King bade him be seated; and, as soon as he sat down, began telling his tale and said to him, "I have dreamt this night a dream which terrified me, and 'twas, that methought I poured water upon the roots of a tree where about were many other trees and as I was thus engaged, lo and behold! fire issued therefrom and burnt up all the growths that were around it; wherefore I was affrighted and fear took me. Then I awoke and sent to bid thee to me, because of thy knowledge and skill in the interpretation of dreams and of that which I know of the vastness of thy wisdom and the greatness of thine understanding." At this Shimas the Wazir bowed his head groundwards awhile and presently raising it, smiled; so the King said to him, "What deemest thou, O Shimas? Tell me the truth of the matter and hide naught from me." Answered Shimas, "O King, verily Allah Almighty granteth thee thy wish and cooleth thine eyes; for the matter of this dream presageth all good, to wit, that the Lord will bless thee with a son, who shall inherit the Kingdom from thee, after thy long life. But there is somewhat else I desire not to expound at this present, seeing that the time is not favourable for interpretation." The King rejoiced in these words with exceeding joy and great was his contentment; his trouble departed from him, his mind was at rest and he said, "If the case be thus of the happy presage of my dream, do thou complete to me its exposition when the fitting time betideth: for that which it behoveth not to expound to me now, it behoveth that thou expound to me when its time cometh, so my joy may be fulfilled, because I seek naught in this save the approof of Allah extolled and exalted be He!" Now when the Wazir Shimas saw that the King was urgent to have the rest of the exposition, he put him off with a pretext; but Jali'ad assembled all the astrologers and interpreters of dreams of his realm and as soon as they were in the presence related to them his vision, saying, "I desire you to tell me the true interpretation of this." Whereupon one of them came forward and craved the King's permission to speak, which being granted, he said, "Know, O King, that thy Wazir Shimas is nowise unable to interpret this thy dream; but he shrank from troubling thy repose. Wherefore he disclosed not unto thee the whole thereof; but, an thou suffer me to speak, I will expose to thee that which he concealed from thee." The King replied, "Speak without respect for persons, O interpreter, and be truthful in thy speech." The interpreter said, "Know then, O King, that there will be born to thee a boy child who shall inherit the Kingship from thee, after thy long life; but he shall not order himself towards the lieges after thy fashion; nay, he shall transgress thine ordinances and oppress thy subjects, and there shall befal him what befel the Mouse with the Cat; and I seek refuge with Almighty Allah!" The King asked, "But what is the story of the Cat and the Mouse?"; and the interpreter answered "May Allah prolong the King's life! They tell the following tale of...
