"I was once in debt to the full amount of three hundred thousand gold pieces; and, being distressed thereby, I sold all that was behind me and what was before me and all I hent in hand, but I could collect no more than an hundred thousand dinars"--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
